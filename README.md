# Module One Challenge 

## Description 

In this challenge we were given the instructions to clone a starter code and replace the div elements with more specific semantic elements. 

**Changes Made:**
* Changed css to remove duplicate rows of text and created one row that explained the type of font the site will use.  
* Changed a few div class names so multiple sections can be affected in css without having mutliple classes seperated in the css 
* Changed all div's to be more specific. The semantic elements that were added are, Header, Nav, Main, Sections, Footer, Article, and Aside. 
* Added alt elements to allow text descriptions of photos when website won't load properly
